| VPN Pivoting Client  >-------------------------------------------------------
`---------------------'

This code is a simple client to demonstrate VPN pivoting with the Windows PCAP
library. It's designed to connect to the simpletun.c server by Davide Brini.

http://backreference.org/2010/03/26/tuntap-interface-tutorial/

The simpletun.c server may crash, occasionally, if you leave BUFSIZE at line
42 set to the default. Consider setting it to a higher value (e.g., 8192).

Build
~~~~~
Before you can build the VPN pivoting client, you must download the WinPCAP
Developer's Kit. This doesn't change too often. Just download the ZIP file
and unzip into this folder [such that there's a ./WpdPack folder in the same
folder as this README].

http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm

The Makefile is setup to build the VPN client on Kali Linux [I know, right?].
To build it, type 'make'.

Use
~~~

1. Start a VPN server with simpletun:

	./simpletun -i [interface] -s -p [port] -a

2. Install WinPcap on client system

	http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm

3. Start the VPN client

	client.exe [server] [port] [localip]

4. On the VPN server system, configure an IP address:

	ifconfig [interface] [target net IP] [mask]

   or request an IP address with a DHCP client:

	dhclient [interface]
